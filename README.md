# codeQuiz
This assignment is to create a timed quiz using Javascript.  This is an interactive quiz using mutliple choice questions.  I will also be using bootstrap to help style this quiz.

This page will have a link in the top left corner to take you to the high scores.  

There is a timer in the top right corner that starts with 75 seconds.  This timer will start when you hit the start button and continue until the quiz is complete or reaches 0.  There is a 10 second penalty for every incorrect answer.  The remaining time left represents your score.
